# Predict Economic Measurements with OpenStreetMap

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is a massive collaborative map of the world, built and maintained mostly by volunteers. On the other hand, there exist various indicators to measure economic growth, prosperity and produce of a country. What if we use OpenStreetMap to predict those economic indicators?
